# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
1. Define Software Engineering :
•Software Engineering is the systematic process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software. It aims to create high-quality, reliable, and maintainable software by following structured methodologies.

•Unlike traditional programming, which focuses on writing code, software engineering encompasses a broader scope, including requirements analysis, design, testing, and ongoing maintenance.


2. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): 
The SDLC consists of several phases:
•Requirements Gathering: Understanding user needs and defining software requirements.

•System Design: Creating a high-level design, architecture, and data models.

•Implementation (Coding): Writing the actual code.

•Testing: Verifying that the software meets requirements.

•Deployment: Installing the software in the production environment.

•Maintenance: Addressing defects and making enhancements1.


3. Agile vs. Waterfall Models: 
 
 •Agile: 
•Iterative and flexible approach.

•Emphasizes collaboration, adaptability, and customer feedback.

•Well-suited for dynamic requirements and changing environments.

 Waterfall: 
•Sequential and rigid approach.

•Phases follow a linear order (requirements, design, coding, testing, deployment).

•Suitable for well-defined, stable projects with fixed requirements1.


4. Requirements Engineering :
•Requirements engineering involves eliciting, analyzing, documenting, and managing software requirements.

•It ensures that the software meets user needs and aligns with business goals.

•Importance: Clear requirements reduce project risks and prevent costly rework1.


5. Software Design Principles: 
•Modularity: Breaking down software into smaller, independent modules.

•Improves maintainability (easier to update or fix specific parts).

•Enhances scalability (adding new features without affecting the entire system)1.


6. Testing in Software Engineering: 
 Levels of Testing: 

•Unit Testing: Testing individual components (functions, classes).

•Integration Testing: Testing interactions between components.

•System Testing: Testing the entire system’s functionality.

•Acceptance Testing: Ensuring the software meets user requirements.

 Importance: Identifies defects early, ensures reliability, and validates functionality.


7. Version Control Systems: 
Version control systems (VCS) track changes to source code.

 Examples: 
•Git: Distributed VCS, widely used for collaborative development.

•Subversion (SVN): Centralized VCS.

• Importance: Facilitates collaboration, tracks history, and enables code branching.


8. Software Project Management :
 *
 Role of a Software Project Manager :* 
•Planning, scheduling, and resource allocation.
Risk management and communication.

•Ensuring project goals are met.

 Challenges : •Balancing scope, time, and resources; handling team dynamics1.


9. Software Maintenance: 
Software maintenance involves modifying and enhancing existing software.

• Types of Maintenance: 
•Corrective (bug fixes).
Adaptive (changes due to external factors).

•Perfective (enhancements).

•Preventive (proactive measures to prevent issues).

 Importance : Sustains software quality and extends its lifespan1.


10. Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering: 

 Ethical issues: 
•Privacy violations.

•Bias in algorithms.

•Intellectual property infringement.

•Adherence to ethical standards:

•Transparency, informed consent, and fairness.

•Regular ethical training for software engineers1.
